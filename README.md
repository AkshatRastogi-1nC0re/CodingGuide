As students of Computer Science and Software Developers have to write a lot of boiler plate code before getting to the actual logic implementation part, thatâ€™s why I implemented a unique functionality inside this script, where upon asking, this script will type a sample boilerplate code in any code editor that the user is working on. This will allow the users to only type the parts that are essential for the working of a specific program.
